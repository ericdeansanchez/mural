## A Micro Library For Wrangling Color Palettes


### Overview

You want to put paint on the page quickly **_and_** you want it to look good. So you
use some color pickers, edit your stylesheets,  `cmd-c`, `cmd-v`, `cmd-r`, maybe restart
a dev-server.

This isn't that. 

**Mural** aims to be a library for wrangling color palettes. The goal is to combine a [few](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) [great](https://docs.imgix.com/apis/url/color-palette/palette) [ideas](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/695) into a library of code that allows developers to build their own palette wrangling workflows.
